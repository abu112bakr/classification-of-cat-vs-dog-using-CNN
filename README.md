# classification-of-cat-vs-dog-using-CNN
classification of cats and dog from image data using CNN

This project demonstrates the classification of images into two categories: cats and dogs. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow library. The data is loaded from image files and preprocessed to train the model for accurate classification. Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

TensorFlow
pickle
Sequential
Dense
Dropout
Activation
Flatten
Conv2D
MaxPooling2D
The dataset is first downloaded from the internet and saved in the computer

# with  dense_layers=[0] layer_sizes=[64,] conv_layers=[3] validation split 0.3 we got val accuracy: 0.612
# and epochs = 10. we got 0.8159 accuracy
#maybe overfeeting happening
